## Description
Systems Administrators and DevOps Engineers have always been charged to do more with less. Defining infrastructure in code and automating its deployment helps improve operational efficiency and lower administrative overhead. In this course, Terraform - Getting Started, you'll learn foundational knowledge of HashiCorp's Terraform software, a tool for infrastructure automation. First, you'll discover how to create and update a basic configuration. Next, you'll explore how to add variables, resources, and providers to expand your deployment. Finally, you'll learn how to leverage abstraction and improve code reuse with functions, state files, and modules. When you're finished with this course, you'll have the skills and knowledge of Terraform needed to write, plan, and create automated infrastructure deployments.

## Notes

### IaC
- Provisioning infrastructure through software to achieve consistent and predictable deployments
- Defined in code: json, yaml
- stored in source control: git
- Declarative
- Idempotent and consistent: if there is no change code and apply it again to the same enviroment, nothing will change
- push-type to the enviroment

#### Benefits of IaC
- Automated deployment
- Repeatable process
- Consistent environments
- Reusable components
- Documented architecture
